# AgenticRAG-Survey

![Agentic RAG Taxonomy](./figures/agentic_rag_taxonomy.png)

A comprehensive survey on **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, exploring foundational principles, paradigms, applications, and future directions. This repository accompanies the paper:

**"AGENTIC RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG): A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY"**

---

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling human-like text generation and natural language understanding. However, their reliance on static training data limits their ability to respond to dynamic, real-time queries, resulting in outdated or inaccurate outputs. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances LLMs by integrating real-time data retrieval, enabling contextually relevant and up-to-date responses.

**Agentic RAG** transcends traditional RAG systems by embedding autonomous AI agents that leverage:
- **Reflection and Planning**
- **Tool Usage**
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**

This survey provides:
- A detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG systems.
- Key applications across industries like healthcare, finance, and education.
- Challenges and future directions for scaling Agentic RAG systems.
