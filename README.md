## Taxonomy of Agentic RAG Systems

Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems can be classified into various architectures and workflows, each tailored to specific tasks and complexities. Below is a detailed taxonomy:

### 1. Single-Agent RAG
- **Key Idea**: A single autonomous agent manages the retrieval and generation process.
- **Workflow**: Retrieves data, processes it, and generates a response in a linear manner.
- **Advantages**: Simple to implement; suitable for basic tasks.
- **Limitations**: Struggles with multi-step reasoning and large-scale data.

### 2. Multi-Agent RAG
- **Key Idea**: Multiple agents collaborate to handle complex retrieval and reasoning tasks.
- **Workflow**: Agents divide tasks dynamically, with each focusing on a specific sub-task.
- **Advantages**: Improved performance for multi-step and distributed tasks.
- **Limitations**: Coordination complexity increases with the number of agents.

### 3. Hierarchical Agentic RAG
- **Key Idea**: Organizes agents in a hierarchy for task prioritization and delegation.
- **Workflow**: Top-level agents assign subtasks to lower-level agents, iteratively refining results.
- **Advantages**: Scalability and modularity.
- **Limitations**: Requires sophisticated orchestration mechanisms.

### 4. Corrective Agentic RAG
- **Key Idea**: Introduces feedback loops where agents evaluate and refine their outputs.
- **Workflow**: Iterative process with continuous improvement based on errors detected.
- **Advantages**: Increased accuracy and reliability.
- **Limitations**: Computational overhead due to multiple iterations.

### 5. Adaptive Agentic RAG
- **Key Idea**: Dynamically adapts retrieval strategies and workflows based on task requirements.
- **Workflow**: Context-aware retrieval and generation with real-time adjustments.
- **Advantages**: High flexibility and context relevance.
- **Limitations**: Challenging to design and implement robust adaptive mechanisms.

### 6. Graph-Based Agentic RAG
- **Key Idea**: Leverages graph structures for multi-hop reasoning and relational understanding.
- **Workflow**: Constructs and traverses graphs to connect related pieces of information.
- **Advantages**: Excellent for tasks requiring relational reasoning.
- **Limitations**: High resource requirements for graph construction and traversal.

### 7. Agentic Document Workflows (ADW)

Agentic Document Workflows (ADW) extend traditional RAG systems by enabling comprehensive automation of document-centric workflows. These workflows integrate parsing, retrieval, reasoning, and structured outputs with intelligent agents.

#### Workflow
1. **Document Parsing and Structuring**:
   - Parses documents (e.g., invoices, contracts) to extract structured fields.
   - Organizes extracted data for downstream processing.

2. **State Maintenance**:
   - Maintains context across multi-step workflows to ensure consistency and relevance.

3. **Knowledge Retrieval**:
   - Retrieves relevant references from external knowledge bases or vector indexes.
   - Fetches domain-specific guidelines for enhanced decision-making.

4. **Agentic Orchestration**:
   - Intelligent agents apply business rules, perform multi-hop reasoning, and orchestrate external APIs and tools.

5. **Actionable Output Generation**:
   - Outputs are presented in structured formats (e.g., reports, summaries) tailored to specific use cases.

#### Key Features and Advantages
- **State Maintenance**: Tracks document context and processing stages.
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale document processing with modular agent integration.
- **Domain-Specific Intelligence**: Applies tailored business rules for precise recommendations.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Automates repetitive tasks, augmenting human expertise.
