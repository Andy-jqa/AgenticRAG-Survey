## **Introduction**

Agentic RAG systems combine the capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation with autonomous decision-making, iterative refinement, and adaptability. By introducing agentic intelligence into RAG workflows, these systems address challenges like hallucination, dynamic query routing, and self-correction.

This repository aims to support researchers, developers, and practitioners by providing:
- A curated collection of survey papers on Agentic RAG.
- Benchmarks and datasets to evaluate RAG systems.
- Examples of agentic patterns in RAG workflows.
- Insights into real-world applications and case studies.
