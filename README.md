## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval mechanisms to generate contextually relevant and accurate responses. While traditional RAG systems excel in knowledge retrieval and generation, they often fall short in handling dynamic, multi-step reasoning tasks, adaptability, and orchestration for complex workflows.

**Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG)** overcomes these limitations by integrating autonomous AI agents. These agents employ core **Agentic Patterns**, such as reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration, to dynamically adapt to task-specific requirements and provide superior performance in:

- Multi-domain knowledge retrieval.
- Real-time, document-centric workflows.
- Scalable, adaptive, and ethical AI systems.

This repository explores the evolution of RAG to Agentic RAG, presenting:
- **Agentic Patterns**: The core principles driving the system‚Äôs adaptability and intelligence.
- **Taxonomy**: A comprehensive classification of Agentic RAG architectures.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Key differences between Traditional RAG, Agentic RAG, and ADW.
- **Applications**: Practical use cases across healthcare, education, finance, and more.
- **Challenges and Future Directions**: Addressing scalability, ethical AI, and multimodal integration.

Whether you‚Äôre a researcher, developer, or practitioner, this repository offers valuable insights and resources to understand and advance Agentic RAG systems.

## Agentic Patterns in Retrieval-Augmented Generation

Agentic RAG systems derive their intelligence and adaptability from well-defined agentic patterns. These patterns enable agents to handle complex reasoning tasks, adapt to dynamic environments, and collaborate effectively. Below are the key patterns central to Agentic RAG:

### 1. Reflection
- **Definition**: Agents evaluate their own decisions and outputs, identifying errors and areas for improvement.
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Enables iterative refinement of results.
  - Enhances accuracy in multi-step reasoning tasks.
- **Example**: In a medical diagnostic system, agents refine diagnoses based on iterative feedback from retrieved data.
- ![Reflection Pattern](./assets/agentic_self_reflection.png)

### 2. Planning
- **Definition**: Agents create structured workflows and task sequences to solve problems efficiently.
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Facilitates multi-step reasoning by breaking down tasks.
  - Reduces computational overhead through optimized task prioritization.
- **Example**: A financial analysis system plans data retrieval tasks to assess risks and provide recommendations.
- ![Planning Pattern](./assets/agentic_planning.png)

### 3. Tool Use
- **Definition**: Agents interact with external tools, APIs, and knowledge bases to retrieve and process data.
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Expands the system's capabilities beyond pre-trained knowledge.
  - Enables domain-specific applications by integrating external resources.

- **Advantages**:
  - Simple architecture for basic use cases.
  - Easy to implement and maintain.
- **Limitations**:
  - Limited scalability.
  - Ineffective for multi-step reasoning or large datasets.

### 2. Multi-Agent RAG

  2. Each agent specializes in a specific sub-task.
  3. Results are aggregated and synthesized into a coherent output.
- **Advantages**:
  - Better performance for distributed, multi-step tasks.
  - Increased modularity and scalability.
