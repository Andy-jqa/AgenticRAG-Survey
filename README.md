# Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A Comprehensive Survey

![Agentic RAG Taxonomy](./assets/agentic_rag_taxonomy.png)

This repository accompanies the paper "Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A Comprehensive Survey," providing supplementary materials, visualizations, and insights into the taxonomy, applications, and challenges of Agentic RAG systems. The goal is to facilitate understanding and adoption of these advanced paradigms by researchers and practitioners.

## Abstract

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring the Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, which enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with dynamic retrieval capabilities and agentic intelligence. Here, you'll find:

- A detailed taxonomy of Agentic RAG systems.
- Visualizations and workflows illustrating the evolution and design of RAG paradigms.
- Applications across industries such as healthcare, education, and finance.
- Discussions on challenges and future directions in the development of Agentic RAG.

This repository complements the survey paper by offering practical insights and tools to advance research and application in this domain.
