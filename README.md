## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems combine the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval mechanisms to generate contextually relevant and accurate responses.

These agents employ core **Agentic Patterns**, such as reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration, to dynamically adapt to task-specific requirements and provide superior performance in:

- Multi-domain knowledge retrieval.
- Real-time, document-centric workflows.
- Scalable, adaptive, and ethical AI systems.

  - Easy to implement and maintain.
- **Limitations**:
  - Limited scalability.
  - Ineffective for multi-step reasoning or large datasets.

### 2. Multi-Agent RAG
- **Key Idea**: A team of agents collaborates to perform complex retrieval and reasoning tasks.

  1. Agents dynamically divide tasks (e.g., retrieval, reasoning, synthesis).
  2. Each agent specializes in a specific sub-task.
  3. Results are aggregated and synthesized into a coherent output.
- **Advantages**:
  - Better performance for distributed, multi-step tasks.
  - Increased modularity and scalability.
- **Limitations**:
  - Coordination complexity increases with the number of agents.

  1. Initial response is generated by the agent.
  2. A critic module evaluates the response for errors or inconsistencies.
  3. The agent refines the response based on feedback.
  4. Steps 2-3 repeat until the output meets quality standards.
- **Advantages**:
  - High accuracy and reliability through iterative improvements.
  - Useful for error-prone or high-stakes tasks.
